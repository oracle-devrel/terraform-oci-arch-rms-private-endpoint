# terraform-oci-arch-rms-private-endpoint

The private Endpoint Management feature enables customers to access private resources on OCI or on-premises(connected to an OCI tenancy) from RMS/ORM. The benefit of this is that customers no longer have to expose their resources to the public internet to remotely execute scripts from the Resource Manager during job execution. We expect this to unveil new usage patterns and consequently bolster the adoption of RMS/ORM among our new and existing customers. 

This reference architecture describes and provides automation to deploy and leverage private endpoint access from the OCI Resource manager and execute certain commands on compute instances hosted on a private subnet.

## Prerequisites

- Permission to `manage` the following types of resources in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy: `vcns`, `internet-gateways`, `route-tables`, `network-security-groups`, `subnets`, and `instances`.

- Quota to create the following resources: 1 VCN, 2 subnets, 1 Internet Gateway, 1 NAT Gateway, 2 route rules, and 1 compute instance.

If you don't have the required permissions and quota, contact your tenancy administrator. See [Policy Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm), [Service Limits](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm), [Compartment Quotas](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcequotas.htm).

## Deploy Using Oracle Resource Manager

1. Click [![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?region=home&zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-arch-rms-private-endpoint/releases/latest/download/terraform-oci-arch-rms-private-endpoint-stack-latest.zip)

    If you aren't already signed in, when prompted, enter the tenancy and user credentials.

2. Review and accept the terms and conditions.

3. Select the region where you want to deploy the stack.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions to create the stack.

5. After creating the stack, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Plan**.

6. Wait for the job to be completed, and review the plan.

    To make any changes, return to the Stack Details page, click **Edit Stack**, and make the required changes. Then, run the **Plan** action again.

7. If no further changes are necessary, return to the Stack Details page, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Apply**.
